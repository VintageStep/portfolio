                        I find CSS quite fun to play with, it seems that just a few years
                        ago it was way more difficult to handle, I won't say it's the easiest 
                        either, but the more I know the more I want to try. I will be uploading 
                        snippets over codepen and listing them here.

                        So far I avoided fidgeting with JavaScript, I wanted to avoid 
                        relying on it unnecessarily so later on I use it just when 
                        it's necessary, but learning it is a task that's happening 
                        sooner than later and I hope I find creative ways to integrate 
                        it to my future snippets, I do have a couple of ideas worth 
                        trying.
